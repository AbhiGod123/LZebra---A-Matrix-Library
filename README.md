# LZebra
An attempt to reinvent the wheel

Just include the LZebra header file for starting

"Source.cpp" shows a simple example of use

This project is just for learning purposes so I know there are many flaws here such as limited error checking, optimizations, etc.

Therefore, it's best to use this only for integral and floating-point types

Another thing is to not use "using namespace" as it can result in namespace collisions

Maybe in future I'll improve this.

Happy coding :)
